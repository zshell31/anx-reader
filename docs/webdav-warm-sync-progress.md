# WebDAV warm sync optimization progress

Branch: `feature/webdav-warm-sync`

Base commit: `bf6c9196 perf(sync): persist local asset verification`

## Scope

1. Stop repeated legacy reading-activity bootstrap imports.
2. Skip clean document downloads when the WebDAV ETag is unchanged.
3. Persist translation-cache synchronization checkpoints across restarts.

Each completed stage is committed separately together with an update to this
file. The full relevant test suite and static analysis must pass before the
branch is considered complete.

## Current stage

Stage 1 is complete. Stage 2 (WebDAV ETag fast-path) is next.

Observed failure mechanism: the legacy import key contains the mutable daily
aggregate duration. Canonical projection writes a larger aggregate back to the
legacy table after a new event, so the next startup creates another legacy
event for the same book and day.

Planned compatibility rule: before importing, recognize a legacy aggregate as
already represented when its value equals the sum of live canonical events.
This also recognizes documents created by older app versions without changing
their event IDs or WebDAV representation.

Implemented:

- Added a stable per-book/day bootstrap receipt (`reading-activity-v2`).
- Reused the live canonical duration calculation before creating a legacy
  event, preventing projected totals from being imported again.
- Preserved v1 event IDs and receipts for wire and downgrade compatibility.
- Added a regression test that imports 90 seconds, records another 30 seconds,
  simulates the projected 120-second legacy row, and verifies that only the two
  real events remain after repeated startups.

## Verification log

- Stage 1: `flutter test test/service/sync/reading_activity_test.dart
  test/service/sync/library_protocol_test.dart` passed (16 tests).

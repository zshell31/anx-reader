# Issue Triage Ledger

Working notes for GitHub issue maintenance in the anx-reader project.

## Purpose

- Use GitHub Issues as the source of truth.
- Record triage decisions, duplicate clusters, and follow-up notes here.
- Do not mirror every issue — keep only what helps future triage.

## Label Set

- `bug` `documentation` `duplicate` `enhancement` `good first issue` `help wanted`
- `invalid` `question` `wontfix` `stale` `Specific books` `upstream limitation`
- `P0` `P1` `P2` `P3`
- `need-test-file` `need-more-info`

## Label Maintenance Guide

### Labels Overview

| Label | Purpose | Auto-triggered? |
|---|---|---|
| `bug` | Something isn't working | No — triage adds manually |
| `enhancement` | New feature or request | No — triage adds manually |
| `duplicate` | Already exists | No — used when closing duplicates |
| `question` | More info needed | **Yes** — GitHub Action adds when platform info incomplete, or when `need-test-file`/`need-more-info` is added |
| `stale` | Inactive for a long time | Manual |
| `wontfix` | Will not be worked on | Manual |
| `P0`–`P3` | Priority level | No — triage adds manually |
| `need-test-file` | Need a test file to reproduce | No — triage adds manually; **triggers `question` label via GitHub Action** |
| `need-more-info` | Need more details from reporter | No — triage adds manually; **triggers `question` label via GitHub Action** |
| `upstream limitation` | Caused by upstream dependency | Manual |
| `Specific books` | Reproducible only with specific book files | Manual |
| `good first issue` | Good for newcomers | Manual |
| `help wanted` | Extra attention needed | Manual |

### GitHub Action Automation

Two workflows manage labels automatically:

1. **`label-trigger.yml`** — When `bug` label is added:
   - Checks if platform info (Platform/OS/Version/Device) is complete
   - If incomplete → adds `question` label + bilingual comment requesting info
   - When `need-test-file` or `need-more-info` is added → adds `question` + request comment

2. **`remove-question-label.yml`** — When issue author responds or edits:
   - Automatically removes `question` label

### Priority Labels (P0–P3)

Apply during triage based on impact:

| Label | Meaning | When to apply |
|---|---|---|
| `P0` | Critical — data loss, security, crash | Immediate fix required |
| `P1` | High — core feature broken, many users affected | Fix before next release |
| `P2` | Medium — feature degraded, workaround exists | Schedule for upcoming cycle |
| `P3` | Low — enhancement, minor, edge case | Backlog, no deadline |
| `P4` | Parking lot — long-term vision, no near-term plan | No deadline; revisit when roadmap shifts |

**Rules:**
- Every bug/enhancement should have exactly one priority label
- When closing a duplicate, do NOT transfer priority — the canonical issue keeps its own
- Priority can change as more reports come in

### When to Add/Remove Labels

**Add labels when:**
- Triaging a new issue (always add `bug` or `enhancement` + priority)
- Confirming a bug (add `bug` if not already tagged)
- Identifying an enhancement (add `enhancement`)
- Requiring info from reporter (add `need-more-info` or `need-test-file`)
- Confirming upstream cause (add `upstream limitation`)

**Remove labels when:**
- `question` — reporter has provided enough info (or auto-removed by Action)
- `duplicate` — when closing (use `gh issue close` with `--reason "not planned"` comment instead)
- `stale` — when issue gets new activity or is being worked on

**Never add these manually:**
- `question` — let the GitHub Action handle it
- `duplicate` — use issue comments with link instead

### Label Maintenance Commands

```bash
export GH_CONFIG_DIR=/home/ubuntu/.config/gh

# Add a label
gh issue edit NUM -R Anxcye/anx-reader --add-label "P2"

# Remove a label
gh issue edit NUM -R Anxcye/anx-reader --remove-label "question"

# Add multiple labels
gh issue edit NUM -R Anxcye/anx-reader --add-label "bug,P1"

# Check current labels
gh issue view NUM -R Anxcye/anx-reader --json labels
```

## Complexity Scale

| Level | Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Trivial | UI text, config, typo, minimal change |
| 2 | Low | Single file, clear logic, small scope |
| 3 | Medium | Multiple files, some context needed |
| 4 | High | Architectural change, core logic involved |
| 5 | Critical | Major refactor, deep system understanding required |

## Record Format

## Code Read Notes

- 2026-05-24: WebDAV sync cluster — inspected `webdav_client.dart`, `sync.dart`. Full-DB overwrite mode confirmed.
- 2026-05-24: TTS cluster — all TTS text fetching depends on WebView JS (`callAsyncJavaScript`). Architecture-level flaw for background playback.
- 2026-05-24: AI cluster — `LangchainAiConfig` null safety issue; `_sanitizeMessagesForPrompt` strips reasoningContent.
- 2026-05-24: Bookshelf cluster — `tb_groups.parentId` exists in DB but UI never uses nested folders. No batch selection mechanism.
- 2026-05-24: Translation cluster — `TranslationMenu` hardcoded to 150px height. Azure 401 = no key format validation.
- 2026-05-24: PDF cluster — PDF rendering performance is systemic issue across multiple reports.
- 2026-05-24: Reading experience — animation controller state bug in no-animation mode (#899); context_menu auto-highlight logic issue (#900).
- 2026-05-24: Windows — close hang likely from async tasks blocking main thread during exit.

## Triage Log

- 2026-05-24: Created ledger with seed entries and label set.
- 2026-05-24: Added Priority, Complexity (1-5) columns; updated to use `isReadByViewer` for incremental triage.
- 2026-05-24: First comprehensive triage — processed 85 unread issues across 8 clusters. Closed 6 duplicates/invalid (#916, #915, #837, #599, #819, #908). Identified key architectural issues: TTS WebView dependency (#544), sync full-DB overwrite (#911), AI null safety (#868, #896). Identified quick wins: #853 (10 LOC), #896 (5 LOC).
|- 2026-05-24: Second pass — added 41 missing issues (231, 243, 323, 546, 564, 634, 643, 667, 668, 833, 848, etc.). Fixed 3 duplicate entries (#754, #919, #839). Corrected #839 classification from WebDAV/Sync to Storage Migration. Added cross-references: #345→WebDAV, #588→Sync, #668→Bookshelf, #612→#834, #888→AI. All 120 open issues now covered.
|- 2026-05-24: Third pass (review) — Added P4 definition to Priority Labels. Closed #93 as duplicate of #920 (canon: more detailed bug report; #93 noted upstream flutter_inappwebview#1204). Closed #858 as duplicate of #849 (same root cause). Fixed #612 Action wording. Noted #835, #23, #114 as referenced-but-unlisted (open issues with no entry).
